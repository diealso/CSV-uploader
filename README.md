# CSV-uploader
App to read data from CSV files

1 - Use the console to install all the dependecies from the API and CLIENT folder. (You have to navigate to /API and /CLIENT folders and run "npm install" on each one to install all the dependencies.)
2 - Navigate to /API and run "npm start" to run the api side of the app.
3 - Navigate to /CLIENT and run "npm start" to run the client side of the app. 
4 - If everything is correct a new window of chrome/firefox/whatever should open with the client side of the app.
5 - Upload a CSV file and run the reader. (If you have doubts about the format or you don't have a CSV with data you can use the ones provided [small or normal csv] in /API/CSV)
6 - Profit
